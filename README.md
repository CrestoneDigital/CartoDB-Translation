# How it works
When enabled it will let a user adjust the language options to pick a local language.  Once selected, whenever you visit the CartoDB Editor by signing into {account}.cartodb.com it will translate all English text into that language.

# Languages
Currently we are starting with Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese.

# Special Thanks

We are honored to have the assistance of Pacific Spatial Solutions (http://pacificspatial.com/) helping us with Japanese translations and sharing this Chrome app in Japan.
